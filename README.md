This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple SPA for testing my knowledge in working with React state, setState, and event handler

* App displaying current state.count
* Adding a button to increase the count by 1
* Adding a method that makes use of setState with prevState so we don't directly modify state
* Adding a button to decrease the count by 1
* Adding a second method that makes use of setState with prevState so we don't directly modify state
* Minimal styling
